# Credit_Risk_Analysis
## Overview
The idea behind this analysis is to try out different machine learning techniques and choose the best one to understand and interpret credit risk. We will classify the potential credit users as either high-risk or low-risk. We will determine which model best predicts the type of credit user depending on the various data points within LendingClub's dataset.
